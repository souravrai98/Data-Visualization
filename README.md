# Data-Visualization
This visualization shows the popular genres in the countries. The dataset has been developed by INRIA. Here's the link for the dataset(https://github.com/micbuffa/WasabiDataset).
The visualization part has been coded in javascript,css and html. I made this on top of this original code from here(https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/bubblemap_buttonControl.html). The preprocessing done here uses a few different other datasets.

This project was developed as part of my course on Data Visualization.
